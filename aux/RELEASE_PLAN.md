# AUX Protocol Release Plan

## Release Philosophy
We follow a predictable, transparent release process that balances innovation with stability, ensuring our users can confidently build on the AUX protocol.

## Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
We follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 2.1.3)
- **MAJOR**: Breaking API changes
- **MINOR**: New features, backwards compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backwards compatible

### Pre-release Versions
- **Alpha**: `x.y.z-alpha.n` - Early testing, unstable
- **Beta**: `x.y.z-beta.n` - Feature complete, stabilizing
- **RC**: `x.y.z-rc.n` - Release candidate, final testing

## Release Cadence

### Regular Releases
- **Patch releases**: As needed (critical fixes within 48 hours)
- **Minor releases**: Monthly (first Tuesday)
- **Major releases**: Quarterly (aligned with roadmap)

### Release Windows
- **Development freeze**: 1 week before release
- **Testing period**: 3-5 days
- **Release day**: Tuesday (optimal for issue resolution)
- **Monitoring period**: 48 hours post-release
